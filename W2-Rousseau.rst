Notes
=====

1. **General Will and Common Good:**

    - The general will is highlighted as the primary force guiding the state according to the common good.
    - Society is governed based on common interests that form the social bond.
    - *Reference:* [1] "the general will alone can direct the forces of the State according to the end of its institution, which is the common good."

2. **Sovereignty:**

    - Sovereignty is characterized as the exercise of the general will, with a focus on its indivisibility.
    - Sovereignty, being the exercise of the general will, cannot be alienated; power can be transferred, but not will.
    - The people's consent is presumed from universal silence when the sovereign is free to oppose commands.
    - *Reference:* [2] "sovereignty, since it is nothing but the exercise of the general will, can never be alienated."

3. **Indivisibility of Sovereignty:**

    - Sovereignty is indivisible; it is either the will of the entire body of the people or only a part.
    - The text argues for the indivisibility of sovereignty, criticizing attempts to divide it into legislative and executive powers.
    - *Reference:* [i] "For the same reason that sovereignty is inalienable, it is indivisible."

4. **Limits of General Will:**

    - The general will tends to be just and upright, but the people's deliberations may not always be equally upright.
    - Discussion on the potential distortion of the general will through factions and partial societies.
    - *Reference:* [4] "It is important, then, that in order to have the general will expressed well, there be no partial society in the State."

5. **Limits of Sovereign Power:**

    - The sovereign power is limited by the general conventions, and individuals retain certain rights.
    - The social pact does not involve a renunciation of individual rights; rather, it leads to a more secure way of life.
    - *Reference:* [10] "as a result of the contract their situation really proves to be preferable to what it had been before."

6. **Right of Life and Death:**

    - Individuals transfer the right to preserve their life to the sovereign through the social contract.
    - The death penalty is justified as a means of preserving the state from criminals who threaten social right.
    - *Reference:* [i] "The social treaty has the preservation of the contracting parties as its end."

**Overall Impression:**

The text navigates the complex relationship between individuals and the state, emphasizing the sacrifice of individual rights for the common good and security. The general will and the limits of sovereign power are central themes, with references providing support for the presented concepts.
