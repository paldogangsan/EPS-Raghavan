Rousseau vs. Hobbes on the State of Nature
==========================================

Thomas Hobbes
=============

**State of Nature:**
- *Description:* Hobbes envisioned the state of nature as a condition where individuals lived without a centralized government or authority. He famously described it as a state of "war of every man against every man."
- *Human Nature:* Hobbes had a pessimistic view of human nature, considering it inherently selfish and driven by a desire for self-preservation. He believed that, in the absence of a common power, life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
- *Social Contract:* To escape the chaos of the state of nature, individuals, according to Hobbes, would willingly surrender their individual freedoms to a powerful sovereign authority through a social contract. The sovereign's role was to maintain order and prevent the anarchy inherent in the state of nature.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau
=====================

**State of Nature:**
- *Description:* Rousseau's concept of the state of nature differed significantly from Hobbes. He argued that in the state of nature, humans were essentially peaceful and harmonious. It was the emergence of private property and societal structures that introduced inequality and conflict.
- *Human Nature:* Rousseau believed that humans in their natural state were fundamentally good, cooperative, and guided by empathy. He coined the term "noble savage" to describe the uncorrupted state of humanity in nature.
- *Social Contract:* Rousseau's social contract theory proposed that individuals voluntarily come together to form a collective body, known as the general will. This general will represents the common interests of the community and forms the basis for legitimate political authority.
