"Leviathan" by Thomas Hobbes
==============================

Chapter 13: "Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as Concerning Their Felicity and Misery"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter, Hobbes delves into his concept of the state of nature, a hypothetical scenario where there is no civil authority or common power to enforce rules. The key points of the chapter include:

1. **The State of Nature:**
   - Hobbes describes the state of nature as a condition of mankind without a political commonwealth.
   - In this state, individuals have equal power and abilities, leading to a constant struggle for survival and dominance.
   - "In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation nor the use of commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force..."
   - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 13, Paragraph 9)

2. **The Natural Equality of Humans:**
   - According to Hobbes, in the state of nature, all individuals are roughly equal in terms of physical and mental capabilities.
   - This equality contributes to the constant competition for resources and security.
   - "Nature hath made men so equal in the faculties of body and mind as that, though there be found one man sometimes manifestly stronger in body or of quicker mind than another, yet when all is reckoned together the difference between man and man is not so considerable as that one man can thereupon claim to himself any benefit to which another may not pretend as well as he."
   - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 13, Paragraph 9)

3. **The Natural Right to Self-Preservation:**
   - Hobbes asserts that in the state of nature, every individual has the natural right to self-preservation, leading to a perpetual war of all against all.
   - The absence of a common power means there is no overarching authority to mediate conflicts or enforce agreements.
   - "During the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war, and such a war as is of every man against every man."
   - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 13, Paragraph 13)

4. **Life in the State of Nature:**
   - Hobbes famously characterizes life in the state of nature as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
   - The absence of a social contract and common authority results in a lack of trust, cooperation, and security.
   - "Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man, the same consequent to the time wherein men live without other security than what their own strength and their own invention shall furnish them withal."
   - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 13, Paragraph 13)

5. **The Desire for Peace and Security:**
   - Hobbes argues that rational individuals in the state of nature would seek peace and security to escape the harsh conditions of constant warfare.
   - This desire for self-preservation becomes a motivating factor for individuals to establish a social contract and form a commonwealth.
   - "So that in the first place, I put for a general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death."
   - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 13, Paragraph 1)

6. **The Necessity of a Commonwealth:**
   - Hobbes concludes that the only way to secure peace and avoid the perils of the state of nature is through the establishment of a sovereign authority or commonwealth.
   - The sovereign's role is to enforce laws, maintain order, and protect individuals from each other.
   - "For the laws of nature (as justice, equity, modesty, mercy, and, in sum, doing to others as we would be done to) of themselves, without the terror of some power to cause them to be observed, are contrary to our natural passions, that carry us to partiality, pride, revenge, and the like."
   - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 13, Paragraph 13)

This part serves as a foundational exploration of Hobbes' justification for the necessity of a strong and centralized government, emphasizing the harsh realities of the state of nature and the need for a social contract to escape it.

Chapter 17: "Of the Causes, Generation, and Definition of a Commonwealth"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Commonwealth and Sovereign Authority:**
      - Hobbes begins by defining a commonwealth as "one person, of whose acts a great multitude, by mutual covenants one with another, have made themselves every one the author."
      - The sovereign authority, or Leviathan, is created by individuals surrendering their natural rights to this common power for the sake of peace and order.
      - "A commonwealth is said to be instituted when a multitude of men do agree and covenant, every one with every one, that to whatsoever man or assembly of men shall be given by the major part the right to present the person of them all..."
      - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 17, Paragraph 1)

2. **Formation of a Commonwealth:**
      - The foundation of the commonwealth is built upon covenants and contracts, where individuals agree to live in accordance with established laws.
      - This social contract involves giving up certain natural rights to the sovereign in exchange for security and protection.
      - "So that in the nature of man we find three principal causes of quarrel. First, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, glory."
      - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 17, Paragraph 12)

3. **Covenants and Contracts:**
      - The foundation of the commonwealth is built upon covenants and contracts, where individuals agree to live in accordance with established laws.
      - Breaking these covenants is seen as a breach of the social contract and can result in consequences.
      - "The mutual transferring of right is that which men call contract."
      - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 17, Paragraph 3)

4. **Artificial Person of the Commonwealth:**
      - Hobbes describes the commonwealth as an "artificial person" created by the individuals, with the sovereign acting as the head or soul of this entity.
      - This artificial person represents the unified will and power of the multitude.
      - "For it is one person, of whose acts a great multitude, by mutual covenants one with another, have made themselves every one the author, to the end he may use the strength and means of them all as he shall think expedient for their peace and common defence."
      - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 17, Paragraph 13)

Chapter 18: "Of the Rights of Sovereigns by Institution"
-------------------------------------------------------

1. **The Authority of the Sovereign:**
      - Hobbes explores the concept of the authority vested in the sovereign by the mutual agreement of individuals.
      - The authority of the sovereign encompasses the right to make and enforce laws, judge disputes, and protect the commonwealth.
      - "A commonwealth is said to be instituted when a multitude of men do agree and covenant, every one with every one, that to whatsoever man or assembly of men shall be given by the major part the right to present the person of them all."
      - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 17, Paragraph 1)

2. **Sovereign's Absolute Power:**
      - Hobbes argues for the absolute power of the sovereign, emphasizing that the authority should be undivided and without limitations.
      - The sovereign's power is essential for maintaining order and preventing a return to the chaotic state of nature.
      - "The sovereign, that is, he whose acts and decrees are owned as the acts and decrees of every one of them, that is, a commonwealth, receiveth the person of them all, and of every one of them, and of all together."
      - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 18, Paragraph 1)

3. **Obligation to the Sovereign:**
      - Individuals are obligated to obey the sovereign's commands as part of the social contract.
      - Hobbes asserts that disobedience threatens the stability of the commonwealth and is a violation of the agreement made for mutual protection.
      - "For the right men have by nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by no covenant be relinquished."
      - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 18, Paragraph 2)

4. **Limits on Subjects' Rights:**
      - While individuals surrender certain rights to the sovereign, Hobbes argues that subjects retain the right to self-preservation.
      - However, the interpretation of what constitutes self-preservation is ultimately determined by the sovereign.
      - "And therefore there be some rights which no man can be understood by any words or other signs to have abandoned or transferred."
      - (Reference: Leviathan, Chapter 18, Paragraph 5)

In summary, Chapters 17 and 18 of "Leviathan" focus on the formation of a commonwealth through a social contract, the authority of the sovereign, and the rights and obligations of individuals within this political structure. Hobbes emphasizes the necessity of absolute sovereign power to maintain order and prevent the chaos of the state of nature.

Class Notes:-
=============

Two Broad questions he answers:-

1. Start of Human Nature
2.

Context Around Hobbes
---------------------

The Spanish sent out their fleets to invade England, called Spanish Harmada (?). Hobbes' mother heard of this Spanish invasion, she immaturely gave birth to Hobbes.
He says that he is twins with Fear, and so Fear became the cornerstone of his thinking and approach to theorizing sociology. 
Along with Theology and Philosophy, the subject Science became prominent in Hobbes' life. 
He poor, he needed to work- so he became a personal tutor to the Earl of Durmenshire's son and future King of England (Charles the Second) . Kinda like a glorified nanny.

He started learning theory behind Euclidean Geometry. He got particularly interested in Axioms. 
What Hobbes took away from this was that to theorize ANYTHING, you need to start with a few Axiomatic principles. 
He turned the existence and presense of Fear as his first Axiomatic Principle.

When political tensions rose, during the English Civil War (bt the Monarchy and the Parliament), Hobbes, a well known Royalist-- escapes to France.
His stay in France is when he wrote this book Leviathon. Since he realized that in the ongoing war, the Royalists were losing, he made sure to be neutral.
When the war died down and Charles the Second became King, he was asked to be brought back to England safely.

What Hobbes caught fire for was not his political views, but his reading of the Bible and Religion.
He couldn't say he was an Atheist, that was wayyy too dangerous to say out loud in the time of Medevial Christianity. But he looked at it systematically, which seemed heretical to the Church and Authority.
His books were banned and burned, but man was cool w it bc atleast he wasn't killed.

Leviathon - 13
--------------

The development of polity and nation, needs to be looked systematically. Hobbes says we start with Human Nature, and the state of Nature.

**To understand Human Nature**

Barebones of Human Nature acc to Hobbes:-

    - Sensory: Touch/ Feel/ See etc 
    - Reason: Capacity to systematically process sensations around us, and to derive a suitable abstraction from it.
    - Passion: Emotions that motivate/persuade humans to do ANYTHING

Humans are Self-Conscious creatures. The fact that we can reflect on others and their actions, means we are capable of reflecting on ourselves. 
Due to this, humans care about how they are percieved, and the emotion "Vainglory" often drives and influences our actions.
All our desires, this web woven by influence by others, pushed by outsiders and driven by comparision, the base line, the start of all this is one thought that all of us begin with is - "Death and The Fear of Death".
Fear of Death/ Insecurity/ Desire to Avoid Death - Becomes another Axiomatic Principle, a basis of understanding Human Nature.

**To understand the State of Nature (Absence of common authority)**

- Absence of Authority. 
- Power over things, which leads to Power over People.
- The State of Nature == State of War, 

In a state devoid of a common social contract, individuals, to be secure, rush to grab power to make sure others wont overpower them. Ex: Countries owning weapons and buying weapons, only cuz country xyz did the same.
In such a state, of constant warfare, we become judges of our own account of good and bad.

Leviathon - 17

**Natural Peace**

- Pursuit of Peace
- Transfer Rights
- Covenant/Pact established


AUTHORITY - not in the excerpts given
-------------------------------------

- Author
- Artificial Person: a authorized person by natural persons.

The unity of the mass of Natural Persons, is not because they group into one, but because they appoint one Artificial Person to represent
